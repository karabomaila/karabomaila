Portfolio project to share about the projects that I worked on. I worked on the project alone and it was a great learning experience. I learnt about Next Js and at the same time I was working on the project. I deployed the website on Netlify. 

### Tech used on the project:
- JavaScript
- React JS
- Next JS
- CSS
- Git and GitHub
- Netlify

I had challenges when working on the project, I lost my laptop and I did not push my code to Github and I lost the code! I learnt the hardway that pushing your code regularly is very important.
