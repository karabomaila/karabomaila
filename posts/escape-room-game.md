It was a third year Computer Graphics course project where we were tasked with creating a game using the Three Js library. It was a group project and I worked with 3 classmates to build the game. We chose to build an Escape room game.

The game had 3 stages and in each stage the player was asked questions and if they answered correctly, they transition to another stage if otherwise they die and go back to stage 1 and they start again.  

### Tech used on the project:
- JavaScript
- React JS
- Three Js
- CSS
- Git and GitHub

We had challeges in the project. We found it difficult to find good resources about Three Js and also we had problems importing the library and working with it in JavaScript. But in the end we managed to finish the project and we presented.
