It was a third year Design Project course project. It was a group project and we were allowed to create a group with up to five members. I worked on the project with 4 classmates and it was nice working on the project. We were meeting online to discuss the project and talk about what each one of us was working on. We used the agile way to develop the project. Each team member chose the user stories they wanted to work on in each sprint.

The project was about developing a social media web app where users can send messages, post statuses, create events and follow people. 

### Tech used in the project:
- JavaScript
- React JS
- Bootstrap
- Firebase
- Git and Gitbub
- Taiger

I mostly worked on the front end of the website and also I was writing tests and testing the app. I was also more involed in the documentation of the project. 

We had challenges in the team, some team members were not doing their work.
