It was a project that I worked on in my second year of my BSc degree in Computer Science. It was a school project and I worked with a classmate. Were allowed to form group of two and work on a project we selected.

The project was about developing a chatting app similar to WhatsApp where a user can send message to their friend, post statuses and also friend or unfriend people. 

### Tech stack used in the project:
- Android studio
- Java
- MySQL

It was challenging working on the project and we had a less time frame to work on the project. We both worked on the UI and the back-end of the app. We had to do research and also watch Youtube videos to learn how to develop the app. 

We were meeting on some days to discuss the app and what we had to work on. And also the features we were going to work on.
